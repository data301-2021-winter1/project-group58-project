## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My group topic is adult income. I am an international student from China, and data science (data analyst) is a relative new occupation in there. On the one hand, the big data has shown everywhere in humans' daily lifeï¼Œand it influences every part of their life. On the one hand, several top IT commpanies in China, such as: Tencent, Tik Tok, HUawei and so on. They are now hiring data analyst with a high salary for unlack people in this occupation. From my own knowledge, over 40 percent of families in China would like to let their children work on traditional things like engineering, nursing, law study, medicine study and etc. This is why data analyst has been a popular occupation in China right now. On the other hand, I am a person who is extremely interested in both data collecting and data analyzing. Because of global Covid-19, all physical type jobs have been stopped and been limited since that. ANd from the prsent process, it does not seem to be fully prevented in next three years. At this point, data analyst has its own advantage which is remote work.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

My group topic is adult income. I immediately looked for the topic once once I had decide to do the research of adult income. According to the Dr.Moosvi's suggestion, I use UCL Machine Learning Company. The dataset I chose was establish 4 years ago, which 2017. On the one hand, it includes the data for US Adult Census data and its social factors such as age, education, race. One the other hand, it also contains other types of data and related information about occupation, age, native country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more. In terms of the salary part, each row is labelled as ">50K" or "<=50K" to illustrate whether it is greater or not. This dataset has two parts, which are adult-test and adult-training. The first part(adult-test) is to summarize each person's basic information. And the goal of the second part is to show categorical and continuous dataset features(but it also has missing values).The categorical columns are: workclass, education, maritalstatus, occupation, relationship, race, gender, nativecountry.The continuous columns are: age, educationnum, capitalgain, capitalloss, hoursper_week. From my opinion, this dataset is quite detailed, but the second part is more related to my topic with more specific information. Therefore, in this research, I choose to use adult-training only for Jupyter lab, and I can analyze the data more clearly.
